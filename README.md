learn-flask
===========

A repo to save the work I've done going through a Flask tutorial.

Each directory is a chapter. At the end of every chapter, I copy the chapter I completed to a new directory and move on to the next chapter.

So in a sense, each directory is a "state" of the tutorial's app.
